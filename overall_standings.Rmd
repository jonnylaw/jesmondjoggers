The overall standings are calculated by summing your best finishing position in three (out of five) races.

```{r overall-standings}
total_races = all_results %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  summarise(total_races = n())

results_by_handicap = all_results %>%
  select(first_name, second_name, position, handicap) %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  spread(key = handicap, value = position)

all_results %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  top_n(n = 3, wt = desc(position)) %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  summarise(points = sum(position)) %>%
  inner_join(total_races) %>%
  inner_join(results_by_handicap) %>%
  filter(total_races >= 3) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(position = dplyr::row_number(points)) %>%
  select(position, first_name, second_name, points, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) %>%
