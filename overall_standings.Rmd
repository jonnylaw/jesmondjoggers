The overall standings are calculated by summing your best finishing position in three (out of five) races.

```{r overall-standings}
total_races = winter_results %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  summarise(total_races = n())

results_by_handicap = winter_results %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(first_name, second_name, position, handicap) %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>% 
  spread(key = handicap, value = position)

winter_results %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  top_n(n = 3, wt = desc(position)) %>%
  group_by(first_name, second_name) %>%
  summarise(points = sum(position)) %>%
  inner_join(total_races) %>%
  inner_join(results_by_handicap) %>%
  filter(total_races >= 3) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(position = dplyr::dense_rank(points)) %>%
  select(position, total_races, first_name, second_name, points, `20181`, `20182`, `20183`, `20184`, `20185`, `20186`) %>%
